# Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Amazon Product Sales: Insights and Trends Across Categories

## Overview:
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset containing Amazon sales data. The dataset, which includes approximately 1.5 million rows, is analyzed using Python and SQL, and visualized through a dashboard created in Power BI. The analysis focuses on key metrics related to product sales, pricing, and customer feedback to uncover insights into sales performance and product characteristics.

## Key Points:
